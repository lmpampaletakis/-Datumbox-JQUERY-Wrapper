It 's a simple jQuery client that allows you to perform Sentiment Analysis (i.e Twitter). It classifies the tweets as positive, negative or neutral depending
on their context.

You can paste your text to the left box and the response will be displayed to the right text box.

Instructions

these fancy stuff could be found here (http://www.datumbox.com/)
